  "disease_information": {
    "name": "Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma",
    "description": "Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency that occurs when the iris blocks the drainage angle in the eye, leading to a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This can cause sudden vision loss and severe pain.",
    "common_symptoms": [
      "Severe eye pain",
      "Headache",
      "Blurred vision",
      "Redness in the eye",
      "Nausea and vomiting",
      "Seeing halos around lights",
      "Stomach ache (referred pain)"
    ],
    "risk_factors": [
      "Age (more common in older adults)",
      "Family history of glaucoma",
      "Farsightedness (hyperopia)",
      "Being of Asian or Inuit descent",
      "Shallow anterior chamber depth",
      "Pupil dilation caused by medications or darkness"

  "recommended_doctor": {
    "specialist": "Ophthalmologist",
    "reason": "An ophthalmologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, including glaucoma. Given the acute and potentially vision-threatening nature of the suspected condition, prompt evaluation and management by an ophthalmologist are crucial."
  },
  "diet_recommendation": {
    "goal": "To support overall eye health and avoid triggers that may exacerbate intraocular pressure.",
    "recommended_foods": [
      "Foods rich in antioxidants (leafy green vegetables, colorful fruits)",
      "Foods containing omega-3 fatty acids (fish, flaxseeds, walnuts)",
      "Hydrating fluids (water, clear broths)"
    ],
    "foods_to_limit_or_avoid": [
      "Excessive caffeine intake (coffee, tea, energy drinks), as it may slightly increase intraocular pressure in some individuals.",
      "High sodium foods, as they can contribute to fluid retention.",
      "Large volumes of fluid intake at one time, as this can temporarily raise intraocular pressure."
    ],
    "lifestyle_tips": [
      "Avoid activities that require prolonged periods in dark environments.",
      "Be cautious about taking medications that may dilate the pupils (e.g., some antihistamines, antidepressants). Consult with your doctor or pharmacist.",

      "Manage stress through relaxation techniques.",
      "Avoid smoking."
